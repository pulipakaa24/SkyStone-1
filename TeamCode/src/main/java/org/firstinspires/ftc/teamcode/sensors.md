##sensors I chose
1. Touch sensor (digitalTouch)
2. Color / distance sensor

##where I would put them & why

The touch sensor would be attached to the very front of the robot. This would allow the robot to
detect when it touches the wall. It would then stop.

The color sensor would be facing toward the left to check whether the wall is red or not. If it is,
the robot can move back 2 feet in relation to the front wall using the built-in distance sensor.
